# Anxiety App - Product Requirements Document

**OVERVIEW**
PRODUCT (WORKING TITLE)
Nuvin
ONE LINE
Instant stress & panic relief—quick, science-backed tools that anchor you to the present, available in under 2 minutes (and offline)
PROBLEM
When anxiety spikes, people don’t want long courses or meditation, they need immediate, actionable relief. Existing apps often feel slow, generic, and online-dependent
SOLUTION
A crisis-first “SOS” app focused on now: tap one big button → guided breath (stacked inhale + long exhale) → grounding (5-4-3-2-1) → physical reset → reframing. Minimal UI, haptics/audio cues, and offline access. Not therapy—just fast tools that work in the moment
TARGET USERS
People who experience acute anxiety, panic, overthinking, sleep anxiety, or work-related stress
Students & young professionals (18–44) who need fast relief during the day/night
CORE VALUE PROPOSITION
Immediate relief (SOS flow first; <2 min)
Simplicity over programs (no long lessons)
Offline-ready for real crises
Privacy first (no-account mode optional)
DIFFERENTIATION
Crisis-ready design (big SOS, haptics, quick actions), lean content optimized for action (breathing, grounding, movement, reframing), and personalization without overwhelming the user
HIGH-LEVEL GOALS
Time-to-relief < 2 minutes from app open
SOS activation rate ≥ 60% of first sessions
Day-7 retention ≥ 20% (stretch vs. market drop-off)
OUT OF SCOPE (MVP)
Therapy/chat with clinicians, long courses, community features, complex CBT curricula. The MVP focuses on fast, reliable, offline tools

Anxiety often shows up as overthinking, perfectionism, trouble sleeping, or toxic relationships.

QUOTES
Existential/ Stoic (Raw truth) = 
Remember, we are all going to die. Noe of this truly matters.
No one will remember this moment, not even you in a year.
All this worry… for nothing. It will pass.
You are a speck on a rock spinning through infinite space. Breathe.
In the immensity of the universe, this fear is dust.
Calming/ Compassionate (default) = 
This is just a feeling. Feelings are not forever.
Your body is reacting, but you are safe right now.
Breathe. You’ve been here before, and you got through it.
Every storm passes. This one will too.
You are stronger than this moment.
Motivational/ Grounding = 
Focus on what you can control: inhale, exhale, repeat.
Your anxiety is lying to you. Reality is calmer than your thoughts.
Action dissolves fear. One breath, one step, once choice.
You’ve already survived 100% of your bad days.
This is not the end, it’s just another wave.

**DESIGN & UX** => no definitive = need to check what is the best
COLORS
Primary background = white purity, breathing space, no visual overload
Accent color = soft violet => calm, serenity, trust
Secondary color = light blue => modern touch, emotional vibe
Emergency color = soft pastel red => stands out clearly for urgent help without being aggressive 
TYPOGRAPHY
Front = Inter => simple, universal, highly readable
Medium for titles + Regular for body text + Bold only for CTAs (buttons)
BUTTONS
Shape = fully rounded (pill style) => friendly and approachable
Normal buttons = light blue or soft violet background with white text
SOS button = red background with white text => the only red element in the app, place prominently 
UX PRINCIPLES
Use lots of white space = lowers cognitive load and anxiety
Keep icons simple (line style, iOS-like)
Use soft animations (fade-in, smooth slide) instead of sharp transitions
NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
PERFORMANCE
App must launch in <2 seconds.
SOS flow should be usable immediately even if offline.
Smooth animations (breathing/grounding visuals run at 60fps).
RELIABILITY
Core SOS flow available 100% offline.
Minimal crash tolerance (target <1 crash per 1,000 sessions).
Data sync with backend should be resilient: queue locally if offline, sync later.
SECURITY & PRIVACY
Journaling data stored locally first (encrypted if possible).
No mandatory account creation (privacy-first, optional login for sync).
GDPR-compliant (data deletion upon request).
SCALABILITY
Backend should support up to 10,000 DAUs without performance degradation.
Modular architecture: easy to add new exercises/tools without breaking SOS flow.
COMPATIBILITY
iOS first (iPhone 12 and above, iOS 16+).
Designed for both light and dark mode.
USABILITY 
SOS button must always be visible and accessible in ≤2 taps.
Accessibility support: large text mode, haptic/audio feedback for visually impaired users.

**MONETIZATION STRATEGY**
MODEL = PREMIUM-ONLY SUBSCRIPTION
No free trial.
No free tier.
No ads.
PRICING
Monthly: €7.99 / $7.99
Annual: €49.99 / $49.99 (≈50% discount vs monthly)
Optional lifetime plan: $99/99€ (one-time purchase)
JUSTIFICATION
Positions the app as serious and trustworthy, not another “free-to-play wellness gimmick.”
Users with real anxiety are willing to pay upfront if the promise is fast, reliable relief.
Removes freeloaders and maximizes early revenue to reinvest in product.
CONVERSION STRATEGY
Clear paywall immediately after onboarding (before using SOS flow).

**TECH STACK**s
IDEA = Xcode
AI assistant = Code Claude
Programming Language = Swift
UI Framework = Swift UI (+UI Kit)
Backend (Database & Authentication) = Supabase/ Firebase => Not for the MVP
Payment = StoreKIt
Payment = Superwall OR RevenueCat
Icon = SF Symbols (native iOS icons)
Security Check = BugBot OR Code Rabbit => Not for the MVP
Version control = Github
Deploy = App Store
Analytics = Mixpanel OR Amplitide OR Appsflyer OR Appfigures
Others tools = XCtest (testing) + Sentry (crash monitoring) + OneSignal (push notifications)

**APP ARCHITECTURE**
PATTERN
Architecture = MVVM (Model-View-View-Model)
Model = Data (user profile, subscription, mood logs, API responses)  
View = UI screens (SwiftUI views)  
ViewModel = Handles business logic, connects Models and Views  
Ensures clear separation of data, UI, and logic for scalability and maintainability.

SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS
Architecture = MVVM  
Database = no backend  
Analytics = Mixpanel / Amplitude
Modularity = Reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Card) 
Config Files = Centralize constants, avoid hardcoding values  
Cloud Functions = Use serverless for dynamic updates  
PERFORMANCE
Optimize images (prefer SF Symbols)  
Keep UI responsive (async tasks, avoid blocking main thread)  
SECURITY
Store sensitive data in Keychain, not UserDefaults  
Use HTTPS for all network calls  
PAYMENTS
In-app purchases via StoreKit or RevenueCat  
DEPLOYMENT & DOCUMENTATION
CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and tests
Maintain a simple README.md with setup & architecture notes
