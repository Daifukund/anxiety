# Anxiety App - UX UI Design Requirements 

**UI/UX DESIGN BEST PRACTICES**
DESIGN PROCESS
Inspiration sources = Phantom, Airbnb, Duolingo => for clarity & playfulness
Reusable components = design once and reuse everywhere (buttons, cards, forms)
LAYOUT & STRUCTURE
Thumb zone = put key actions where thumbs naturally reach
8pc grid system = all spacing, padding, and size should be multiples of 8px
Scrolling = avoid unnecessary scrolling, keep key actions above the fold
Hiearchy = one main CTA per screen, secondary action less visible 
COLORS & VISUAL STYLE
60/ 30/ 10 rule = 
60% = primary neutral (background, large areas)
30% = secondary color (support elements)
10% = accent (highlights & CTA buttons only)
Accent color = only for clickable actions (buttons, links)
Minimalism = reduce visual noise => favor space
TYPOGRAPHY & ICONS
Font Sizes (max 4 styles)
Title = large (semibold)
Subtitle = medium (regular/ semibold)
Body = regular
Small = caption/ labels
Consistency = always use the same weights (semibold/ regular)
Icons = use SF Symbols (decide filled vs outlined and stay consistent)
FEEDBACK & INTERACTION
Haptic feedback = for positive confirmations (likes, successful saves, purchases)
Micro-animations = subtle transitions, not distracting
Clear states = buttons show pressed/ disabled/ active states
Error prevention = validate inputs early and clearly 
UX PRINCIPLES
Coherence = identical components behave the same everywhere
Accessibility = high contrast, readable fonts, avoid color-only indicators
Trust = clear privacy, safe data handling, transparent UI copy
